Robotics for rehabilitation treatment is an emerging field that is expected to grow as a solution to automate training.This device addresses the lack of assistive devices for people with walking difficulties around the globe. A major problem they suffer is their dependency on a caretaker for basic tasks such as toiletries and fetching water or food for themselves. This is also common among people with paraplegia ,hemiplegia and cerebral palsy. As post-treatment care and constant help cost a lot, this is where we decided to focus our energies on.
Robotic rehabilitation can replace the physical training effort of a therapist, allowing more intensive repetitive motions and delivering therapy at a reasonable cost, assess quantitatively the level of motor recovery by measuring force and movement patterns. We have found that early rehabilitation in people with cerebral palsy will help in regaining their walking capabilities.
